The goal of the the prelimary results is to identify data sources and analysis methods a priori before a more in depth analysis. This project utlized a comparative case study, using matrix analysis, to identify themes and pedalogical patterns of learning in two affinity spaces.
 
First we began with a martix utitlizng Gee's 11 characteristics of Affinity Spaces (see appendix or we can put in table/aside if publisher allows). These were then cross populated with evidence collected. We then examined the data across the matrix using our theoreretical lens as a tool for data reduction.

This lead us to collapse the 11 principles into four descriptive themes: goals, organizational structure, content creation, and knowledge brokering. Once we had the four agreed upon themes we returned to the data sources and looked for illustrative examples from within the community.

## Community Selection
Given our goal of describing learning from your own website we chose two spaces to study that were deeply entrenched in blogging communities. DS106 and IndieWeb. DS106 was an online digital storytelling class launched in 2008. IndieWebCamp was a movement focused on personal ownership of the social web that began in 2010.  

These spaces were ideal for comparative case study analysis of networked learning. They share a relative similarity in age, the participants and founders often overlap, and mroe importantly they utilize a similar worldview that governs the sociotechnological systems deployed by each affinity space.
