A few notes I have based on the outline.  Don't want to go overboard before I get a clearer sense of the paper's direction.

Hopefully some of this is useful, in which case I'm happy to flesh it out



## Introduction
### Vignette
* To complement section on arguing/fake news
  * Platform’s algorithms shape what information we see (Pariser, 2012).
  * Platform users are generally unaware of the nature and extent of these algorithms (Eslami et al., 2015).
  * Even empowered groups are subject to platforms' decisions about content moderation: When Facebook censored a Norwegian journalist's posts containing *Terror of war*, a famous Vietnam war photograph depicting a child fleeing a napalm attack, the editor of Norway’s Aftenposten newspaper called Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg “the world’s most powerful editor” (Sjefredaktør, 2016).
  * *These examples emphasise a power imbalance between platforms/individuals, which #DoOO and IndieWeb attempt to address*



## Two Tales of One Web
###  IndieWeb
* IndieWeb is a community founded in 2011 as a "people-focused alternative to the corporate web" (IndieWeb.org, 2018).
* Personal websites; employ new standards forpeer-to-peer social networking among individual sites; Remain connected to corporate social media platforms through syndication tools. *Can add as much detail as needed here*
* IndieWeb's web page (indieweb.org) presents three core reasons for  using the IndieWeb instead of centralized platforms: “Your content is yours”; “You are better connected”; and “You are in control” (IndieWeb.org, 2018)
* According to IndieWeb's co-founder, these values are ultimately about self-empowerment (Çelik, 2016).
* *Maybe discuss /generations, especially the self-empowerment of gen 1 building their own tools, and then ongoing efforts to make indieweb accessible to gen 2+.*
* *Also worth noting the difficulty of IndieWeb for non-technical people, and strategies for addressing this.  Building this literacy works toward the scientific literacy Dewey associates with "The Great Community" (Dewey, 1927)*

## Theoretical perspective
* I'll need to read more of what you're thinking here. I typically draw from STS (infrastructures, human and nonhuman relationships, affordances, etc.) and political economy.  This could contribute to a big picture discussion of power imbalances with platforms, which adds rationale for owning one's own communication tools.
* Related: Introna (2014) has a good paper about how humans and nonhumans co-constitute one another. Uses turnitin to illustrate agential realism.  I think this is a useful lens for arguing the importance of giving students the right tools.
* **I think these directions might be out of scope for this article, and may not necessarily fit with your theoretical perspective**
