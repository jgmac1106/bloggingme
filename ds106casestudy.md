## Introduction

DS106, Digital Storytelling 106, began  marked the first time a MOOC wasn’t used to either study open education or the use of tools like social media or wikis. In fact the online class was the first distributed classroom utilizing both the plumbing and the philosophy of open pedagogy to teach domain specific knowledge of digital storytelling. DS106 brought an ethos of focusing on the web as our primary source of identity. From this perspective the  first step in learning digital storytelling is figuring out how to tell the story of you.

For Jim Groom, course creator, this meant starting with your personal cyberinfrastructure (Gardner, 2010) and a Domain’s of One’s Own. Groom felt students shoul join a community of creators, make stuff,  and reflecting on the process of all three .The community gathers loosely under an  ethos of what Jim Groom coined  as “EduPunk.” A Do-It Yourself approach to learning that rejects the corporate interest in the formulation of edtech.

## History

DS106 began at the University of Mary Washington in 2010 as an online adaption of a computer science class focused on digital story telling. To date the class has aggregated and archived over 76 thousand blog post. The class is taught for credit on college campuses but their is also an avid cult like following (Downes, 2018) that creates a multi-generation affinity spaces. The community support page has over 60 names of open participant who made the hall of fame for their support of the open course work.

In terms of the socio-technical system DS106 works with every student having their own blog. These posts are then fed to an RSS aggregator. The majority of students taking the class are college students who take the class for credit. However there are approximately thirty people who participate almost every day annually. 

DS106 also relied heavily of Twitter and Google+ as social networks. In the 2014-2015 year, for example, over a thousand people used the #ds106 hashtag on Twitter sharing 14,361 tweets. 402 people sent more than two tweets, 210 participants sent over 10 tweets, and 30 people sent over 100 tweets. 

The class included the module of events and then a series of daily creates that are randomly chosen from an assingment bank of hundreds of task. There are also a series of weekly events found in traditional classes. In some semsters there was a physcial classroom presence and other semesters a mix of online or physcial drop in help.

At the same time the larger DS106 community began to flourish and launch seperate programs such as a 24 hour radio station playing to this day. "DS106radio is interesting in week one there was no #ds106 radio. I put out a Twitter message like, 'you know what #ds106 needs is a radio staion" Then an open participant in Canaa took it upon himself to set up a server and start a radio station. This rhizomatic growth of learning (Cormier, 2015) would not be possible without the holistic technologies used in human sociotechnical systm. There were community spun classes around Noir and Westerns. The group was very active on Google+ and on Twitter. Especially completing daily creates with a hashtag that is very active.

## Shared Goals as a Community
#DS106Radio4Life and #Ds1064Life these call to actions permeated many of the artifacts collected as part of this study, and you can hear in the open participants voices how much they take it to heart. http://www.edutalk.info/the-ds106-good-spell-episode-38/ (Johnston & Funes, 

In Gee's model of affinity spaces 

"Between the creativity, remixing my culture, and creating a communi... actually tapping into an amazing community [sic]The people I have met have blown my mind" (Forsyth, 2011)

"A digital identity should be an online address one can have no matter where they are, a space where you can track that person as they move not only from being a freshman to a sophomore, but from an undergraduate to a graduate and beyond. An online home where they consciously integrate their professional profile through a streaming set of resources and spaces they inhabit online."

"An experiment in Thinking where we ask the students to frame their narrative on their own space and on their own way" (Groom & Burris, 2011) 

"In just two weeks I was doing something I have never done before. I have a blog. Something I am very proud of. As the student looks back at the page." (Linda, 2012). As the student panned over a two week reflection post in a fnal course reflection. In the post she discusses how cool it is to have her own website.

### Membership Pathways and Barriers

"We have a place for you, when you are ready come on through" A collaborative song lyric on the power of learning while lurking in the community (Hodgson & Funes, 2018).

#### Leadership Pathways and Barriers

course objectives

> * Develop skills in using technology as a tool for networking, sharing, narrating, and creative self-expression.
> * Frame a digital identity wherein you become both a practitioner in and interrogator of various new modes of networking
> * Critically examine the digital landscape of communication technologies as emergent narrative forms and genres
