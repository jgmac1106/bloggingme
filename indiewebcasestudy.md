## Introduction
## History
2010 Federated web summit too much talk not enough build" (Case, 2014) "klet's write this spec, and start this mailing list, and what about this idea"
"The whole point is you implement something and you show it to the community. Whoever has the best story doesn't win, the best implementation wins"
"You can't make the perfect spec. That is a Platonic ideal"
 
## Shared Community Values
"Community is a huge aspect. It is a big differentiator. We are all working on a shared goal but we are all doing it by having our wesbites talk together and work on the problem together." Parecki then goes on to describe how people build tools for themselves but these in turn provide hosting solutions that help others. 

>This is why I think it is exciting that the IndieWeb inherently follows this method. Work small, demo, integrate into the whole what works, and you get this emergent structure out of that that’s resilient, with things evolving at the edges out of people exploring new projects. (Case, 2014).

> Now I’m not a Web Developer, but I think I’d like to try my hand at it. I don’t need to centralize all of my data but I would like an online presence that I control. Something that I could constantly work on. Something that’s never finished. Much like the web itself

### Membership and Barriers
People attracted to the community through podast episodes. Examples: Ben and Kevin on Twing. Rosemary Orchard heard an episode of Mac power users and tried micro.blog. Other users come to the IndieWeb by discovering about it in ther RSS feeds.

"Number One thing you have to do is sign into the website. If you didn't have your own domain you could talk all you wanted to but you had to show atleast you are dedicated to the cuase of owning your own data." "This filtered out the didn't want to do the iota of work, these people are interested in talking but they don't implement.

Something to be said about people turning to the IndieWeb when dissatisfied with other movements. IndieWebCamp started after disatisfaction with W3c,. A post by Jeena and Tents: https://jeena.net/indieweb 
>  Sadly they took a wrong turn so I had to jump of and find something else which would get me in the direction I wanted, which is owning the data I post to the internet. I am trying to archive it not because it is easy, but because it is hard.

No mailing lists, whomever talks the best shoiuld not win
