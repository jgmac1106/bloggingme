## Power, platforms, and individuals

The internet, like many communication technologies before, has been described as both democratizing and oppressive.  Celebrants have emphasized the Internet’s capacity for supporting new forms of collaboration, democratic participation, and community (e.g. Shirky, 2008, 2010). By contrast, skeptics have highlighted ways that the Internet may limit knowledge sharing and generation (e.g. Pariser, 2012).  McChesney (2013) argued that celebrants and skeptics of the Internet present radically different perspectives, both with significant merits yet flawed by a lack of ‘political economic context’ (p. 13). We argue that platforms simultaneous empower and disenfrancise their users, and propose that personal websites can shift this balance in individuals' favour.

The Internet’s transformation away from personal websites and toward platforms has many positive effects: Notably it is easier than ever for many individuals to instantly communicate with masses of others. The rise of ‘Web 2.0’ in the mid-2000s broadened the Internet’s reach as platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and others made it accessible for individuals to produce and share content online. The business model supporting this participation is predicated on platforms’ capacities to aggregate and commodify users’ participation (Cohen, 2013), for example by “set[ting] inclusive defaults for aggregating user data as a side-effect of their use in the application” (O’Reilly, 2005, p. 5). Whereas barriers for online participation have lowered, this has generally been accomplished in ways that empower platform operators most of all.

One of the most effective design patterns for platforms has been to streamline or automate decision-making, so as to make it easier and faster for users to write, share, and interact with Web content. A key example of this strategy is the rise of algorithmic news feeds, which prioritize or diminish content based on automated decisions whose logic is rarely apparent to users (Eslami et al., 2015). Similarly, the proliferation of simple, predetermined interactions—e.g. likes, shares, retweets—across platforms and throughout the Web encourages frequent interactions which can be commodified as _platform-ready_ data (Helmond, 2015).

This sort of streamlining makes the Internet more accessible by reducing the requirement and ability to make decisions about how and where to seek, respond to, and share knowledge.  Many of the technical and other tasks required to maintain an online social world are simplified into a series of steps — scroll through a newsfeed, click 'like', write a reply — and this encourages individuals to use the internet in a way that generates commodifiable data for platform operators. Franklin's (2004) concepts of _holistic_ and _prescriptive_ technologies are useful for evaluating this design pattern's effects.  Holistic technologies are those that support craft-like approaches where the wielder of a tool retains control of their process including decision-making and planning.  In constract,  prescriptive technologies enact a division of labour between planning and execuion by reconstituting one large job as a series of small steps. A key consequence of prescriptive designs is that they “eliminate the occasions for decision-making and judgement in general and especially for the making of principled decisions” because “any goal of the technology is incorporated a priori in the design and is not negotiable” (Franklin, 2004, p. 18). While we rejoice at how online platforms have lowered barriers to online participation, this has come at the expense of opportunities for the sort of principled decision-making we want to instill in our students.

## Humans and sociotechnical systems



-	Infrastructures of the web are sociotechnical, composed of material technologies, technical specifications, organizations, individuals, etc. (see Hughes)
-	The process of using such an infrastructure is one of co-creation, whereby the system’s components (including human users) influence and are influenced by one another.
-	This extends from STS perspectives such as actor-network theory (Latour, 2008),  Social Construction of technology,
-	Acknowledging that, not only do these systems influence students, but that students can shape them back, requires seeing them as matters of concern rather than matters of fact (Latour, 2004)
  -	i.e. as structures that are continually being redefined and can be influenced (are worthy of concern), rather than static, immutable (matters of fact)

- 	However, must also acknowledge varying levels of prescriptiveness, momentum, etc, which influence the capacity of individuals to shape systems. << This connects back to the power issues.
-	By encouraging the use of a personal website, over which students can exert considerable agency, we increase their potential to shape the internet more broadly.
