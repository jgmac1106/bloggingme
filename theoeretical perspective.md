## Power, platforms, and individuals

The internet, like many communication technologies before, has been described as both democratizing and oppressive.  Celebrants have emphasized the Internet’s capacity for supporting new forms of collaboration, democratic participation, and community (e.g. Shirky, 2008, 2010). By contrast, skeptics have highlighted ways that the Internet may limit knowledge sharing and generation (e.g. Pariser, 2012).  McChesney (2013) argued that celebrants and skeptics of the Internet present radically different perspectives, both with significant merits yet flawed by a lack of ‘political economic context’ (p. 13).  *Add sentence explaining that/how our study incorporates political economy*

The Internet’s transformation away from personal websites and toward platforms has enhanced the power exercised by operators of those platforms at the expense of individual users. The rise of ‘Web 2.0’ in the mid-2000s broadened the Internet’s reach as platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and others made it easier for individuals to produce and share content online. The business model supporting this participation is predicated on platforms’ capacities to aggregate and commodify users’ participation (Cohen, 2013), for example by “set[ting] inclusive defaults for aggregating user data as a side-effect of their use in the application” (O’Reilly, 2005, p. 5).
One of the most effective design patterns for platforms has been to streamline or automate decision-making, so as to make it easier and faster for users to write, share, and interact with Web content. A key example of this strategy is the rise of algorithmic news feeds, which prioritize or diminish content based on automated decisions whose logic is rarely apparent to users (Eslami et al., 2015). Similarly, the proliferation of simple, predetermined interactions—e.g. likes, shares, retweets—across platforms and throughout the Web encourages frequent interactions which can be commodified as _platform-ready_data (Helmond, 2015).

This sort of streamlining exemplifies what Franklin (2004) has called _prescriptive_ technologies, whereas processes involved in maintaining a personal website of owns own are more _holistic_.  Holistic technologies are those that support craft-like approaches where the labourer maintains control over their labour process, and prescriptive technologies reconstitute one large job as a series of small steps. A key consequence of prescriptive designs is that they “eliminate the occasions for decision-making and judgement in general and especially for the making of principled decisions” because “any goal of the technology is incorporated a priori in the design and is not negotiable” (Franklin, 2004, p. 18).
- That sort of principled decision-making is necessary for democratic participation (connect back with Dewey argument about democratic participation)



## Humans and sociotechnical systems

-	Infrastructures of the web are sociotechnical, composed of material technologies, technical specifications, organizations, individuals, etc. (see Hughes)
-	The process of using such an infrastructure is one of co-creation, whereby the system’s components (including human users) influence and are influenced by one another.
-	This extends from STS perspectives such as actor-network theory (Latour, 2008),  Social Construction of technology,
-	Acknowledging that, not only do these systems influence students, but that students can shape them back, requires seeing them as matters of concern rather than matters of fact (Latour, 2004)
  -	i.e. as structures that are continually being redefined and can be influenced (are worthy of concern), rather than static, immutable (matters of fact)

- 	However, must also acknowledge varying levels of prescriptiveness, momentum, etc, which influence the capacity of individuals to shape systems. << This connects back to the power issues.
-	By encouraging the use of a personal website, over which students can exert considerable agency, we increase their potential to shape the internet more broadly.
