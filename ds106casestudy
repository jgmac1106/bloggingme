## Introduction

DS106, Digital Storytelling 106, began as an online course also offered openly at the University of Mary Washington. The  marked the first time a MOOC wasn’t used to either study open education or the use of tools like social media or wikis. A distributed classroom utilized both the plumbing and the philosophy of open pedagogy to teach domain specific knowledge.DS106 brought an ethos of focusing on the web as our primary source of identity. From this perspective the  first step in learning digital storytelling is figuring out how to tell the story of you. For Jim Groom, course creator, this meant starting with your personal cyberinfrastructure (cite) and a Domain’s of One’s Own, joining a community of creators, and reflecting on the process of both.

The community gathers loosely under an  ethos as “EduPunk.” A Do-It_Yourself approach to learning that rejects the corporate interest in the formulation of edtech.
