## Art of the Self in Blogging and Learning
Both the the #IndieWeb and the #DS106 community put an emphasis on first creating yoru own space on the world and then conencting with others. This common element explains much of the success of both communities. For open source and open classes to survive and grow they must cultivate the learner while also allowing the learner to cultivae using the knowledge of the community.

Dewey recgonized the impossibilty to seperate art from learning and the role of community in the art. In fact he wrote:
>Hence an experience of thinking has its own aesthetic quality. It differs from those experiences that are acknowledged to be aesthetic, but only in its materials. The material of the fine arts consists of qualities; that of experience having intellectual conclusion are signs or symbols having no intrinsic quality of their own, but standing for things that may in another experience be qualitatively experienced.

The same good be said about writing yourself on the web as Dewey says for the material of fine arts. There are so many incidents of intellectual connclusions from learners in both communities. From adding a new feature to your website or building a new CMS. Yet these culminate into the aesthetic experience of building a personal digital infastructure. 

The focus on the art of the experience makes both these communtiites thrive because the community itself gets sustained by the very creation of art. In other words the more people who make websites the better  #ds106 and #indieweb communites act at helping people build websites.

## Community and Democracy as Curriculum
 Networks are based on voluntary association (otherwise, the forming/breaking of connections doesn't mean anything).(Downes, 2018). In these communities there are both voluntary and mandatory associations.In #DS106, there are the university students, thier instructors and all the support, systems and barriers that come with formal learning environmnets. Yet there is also a strong community of open participants that never really stop #ds106ing.

 
 
## Human Sociotechnincal Solutions
No formal structures exist. However, many of the founders and early members worked on numerous projects and on w3c community and working groups together and have helped steer the project over the years.

Both show, not tell communities, both rely on websites and feeds

Distributed nature of knowledge

## Addressing Barriers
Both communities introduce friction

The #IndieWeb community remains a 100% volunteer network. The community, like much of the tech world, trends white and male but photographic records do show a long history of multi-generational learning.
