## Art of the Self in Blogging and Learning
Both the the #IndieWeb and the #DS106 community put an emphasis on first creating yoru own space on the world and then conencting with others. This common element explains much of the success of both communities. For open source and open classes to survive and grow they must cultivate the learner while also allowing the learner to cultivae using the knowledge of the community.

Dewey recgonized the impossibilty to seperate art from learning and the role of community in the art. In fact he wrote:
>Hence an experience of thinking has its own aesthetic quality. It differs from those experiences that are acknowledged to be aesthetic, but only in its materials. The material of the fine arts consists of qualities; that of experience having intellectual conclusion are signs or symbols having no intrinsic quality of their own, but standing for things that may in another experience be qualitatively experienced.

The same good be said about writing yourself on the web as Dewey says for the material of fine arts. There are so many incidents of intellectual conclusions from learners in both communities. From adding a new feature to your website or building a new CMS. Yet these culminate into the aesthetic experience of building a personal digital infastructure. 

The focus on the art of the experience makes both these communtiites thrive because the community itself gets sustained by the very creation of art. In other words the more people who make websites the better  #ds106 and #indieweb communites act at helping people build websites.

## Community and Democracy as Curriculum
Networks are based on voluntary association (otherwise, the forming/breaking of connections doesn't mean anything).(Downes, 2018). In these communities there are both voluntary and mandatory associations.In #DS106, there are the university students, thier instructors and all the support, systems and barriers that come with formal learning environmnets. Yet there is also a strong community of open participants that never really stop #ds1064Life.


## Human Sociotechnincal Solutions

Signs and Symbols systems.

No formal structures exist. However, many of the founders and early members worked on numerous projects and on w3c community and working groups together and have helped steer the project over the years.

Both show, not tell communities, both rely on websites and feeds

Distributed nature of knowledge

## Addressing Barriers
Both communities demand high levels of intensive knowledge from participants. This does take work and having the time and freedom to do this work does come with privledge. Many in the #ds106 community are educators and artist who are driven to live the writerly life often as models for their students. 

The #IndieWeb community remains a 100% volunteer network. The community, like much of the tech world, trends white and male but photographic records do show a long history of multi-generational learning. It must be noted the community had female founders and the first IndieWebCamp had equal gender representation. **<<According to https://indieweb.org/2011/Guest_List#Final_Count 25% of participants were women (9/36).  This section compares to the previous year's federated social web summit which had only one woman attendee of 37 participants. from the wiki: "I'd say that's progress. " ** This may have been inadverntently reinfocred by the earlier barrier of entry of having your own domain. This criterion of membership was relaxed, espcially after the introduction of Homebrew Website Club. Recent efforts

There is a cost to these efforts, "There is a cost to all of this Maha's key note."


## Holistic Technologies
Participants at these sites have access to relatively holistic authoring tools, especially when compared to platform-based alternatives. Both DS106 and IndieWeb strive for a sense of individual ownership over not only the content of one's website but also the process of its creation. In practice, the web publishing tools used among participants have a range of prescriptiveness.  Novice web designers are likely to rely upon easy-to-use content management systems such as WordPress, which are more flexible than sites like Facebook and Twitter but nonetheless encourage standardized structures including chronologically based blogs and ready-made 'themes' for determining the appearance of sites. In contrast, highly skilled participants may build their own software or write their site's HTML from scratch, in which case they can control exercise greater control over their work process and decisions.

- Range of prescriptiveness inversely proportionate to technical skill
- In theory, entry points for different skill levels.  In reality, IndieWeb's struggles to reach gen 2+ demonstrate that entry is difficult at lower levels.
- Successes for reaching novices have been through structured pedagogical relationships (IndieWeb mentors/ inviting friends to events.  DS106 as a MOOC)
- Not everyone is going to write their own software or HTML from scratch, but these spaces provide an opportunity for learning how to use increasingly open-ended systems and to make informed decisions about the pros and cons of prescriptive tools
